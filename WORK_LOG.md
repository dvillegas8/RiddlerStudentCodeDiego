| Aug 22 |   10:30-11    |                                                                                                                                         Figured out #2 is ASCII and thinking about how to solve with code |
| Aug 22 |   11-11:30    |                                                                                                                                                          Figured out #1 and working decrypting #2 in code |
| Aug 22 | 11:30 - 12:00 |                                                                                                                                                           Finished #2 but debugging because it has errors |
| Aug 22 |  6:30 - 7:00  |                                                                                                                                                                                               Finished #1 |
| Aug 23 | 10:10 - 10:40 |                                                                                                                           Worked on decrypting #3, finished the function for #3, working on decrypting #4 |
| Aug 23 |  6:00 - 6:30  |                                                               Working on #3 because I want to understand the bitwise operators. Still couldn't understand bitwise and so decided to work on decrypting #4 |
| Aug 23 | 9:20 - 10:10  |                                                                                                                                                                                               Finished #4 |
| Aug 23 | 10:10 - 10:55 | Worked on fixing all the functions because I realized that it printed numbers instead of the actual letters, figured out that I forgot to cast the numbers into chars, Ended up finishing the whole thing |
